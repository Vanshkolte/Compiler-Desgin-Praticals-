## Introduction

This repository is a collection of programs and solutions designed to help students and enthusiasts understand the working of compilers by implementing core functionalities. From token generation in lexical analysis to building LL(1) parsing tables, these practicals provide hands-on experience in compiler design.

---

## Features

- Step-by-step implementation of compiler design phases.
- Solutions for common problems like removal of left recursion, left factoring, and more.
- Easy-to-understand and well-documented code.
- Modular structure for better readability and extensibility.

## Practicals Included

1. **Lexical Analyzer**
   - Token generation from source code.
   - Identification of keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, etc.

2. **Removing Left Recursion**
   - Algorithm to eliminate left recursion in context-free grammar.

3. **Left Factoring**
   - Technique to modify grammar to remove ambiguity.

4. **FIRST and FOLLOW Sets**
   - Compute FIRST and FOLLOW sets for given grammar.

5. **LL(1) Parsing Table**
   - Generation of parsing table for LL(1) grammar.

6. **Recursive Descent Parser**
   - Implementation of a top-down parser for given grammar.

7. **Intermediate Code Generation**
   - Basic block and three-address code generation.

8. **Code Optimization Techniques**
   - Constant folding, dead code elimination, and other optimizations.

9. **Code Generation**
   - Translation of intermediate code to target machine code.
